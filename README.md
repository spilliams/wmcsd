##Theme

- About page (/all pages)
    - not readable enough (blue and orange only?)
    - pictures should blow up in a lightbox (don't do extra tabs--takes the user outside the experience)
- moar templates
- mobile?
- load bg image asynchronously or compress it or something (use a smaller res too--something 1080h?)
- finish sticky header
