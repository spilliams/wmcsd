Williams &amp; Meyer, and the Corps of Self-Discovery

#Todo

##Stack

- heroku addon: New Relic
- wp plugin: WP Read-Only
    - Amazon S3

##Content

- About page
    - Grace bio
    - Grace gear
    
##Theme

- About page (/all pages)
    - not readable enough
    - pictures should blow up in a lightbox (don't do extra tabs--takes the user outside the experience)
- moar templates
- mobile?
- load bg image asynchronously or compress it or something (use a smaller res too--something 1080h?)
- finish sticky header
