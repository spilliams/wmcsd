Williams &amp; Meyer, and the Corps of Self-Discovery

#Todo

##Stack

- heroku addon: New Relic (waiting on NR guys for integration)

##Content

- About page
    - Grace bio
    - Grace gear
    
##Theme

- About page (/all pages)
    - not readable enough (blue and orange)
    - pictures should blow up in a lightbox (don't do extra tabs--takes the user outside the experience)
- moar templates
    - video post
    - image gallery
    - should these even be separate types of post? That's one more thing for admin to curate.
- mobile?
- more WP-BP
    - for instance, "Captains", title, subtitle, banner, footer widgets
    - sidebar
    - comments
    - search
    - dynamically-created nav
- load bg image asynchronously or compress it or something
